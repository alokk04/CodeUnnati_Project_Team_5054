 Gesture-Controlled Subway Surfers: Enhancing Gameplay Experience for Healthier Gaming

Abstract
In the digital age, video games have become an integral part of our lives, providing entertainment and relaxation. However, prolonged gaming sessions can lead to sedentary behavior, negatively impacting physical health. To address this issue, we propose a project that combines technology, health, and gaming. Our goal is to create a gesture-based interface for controlling the popular mobile game ‚ÄúSubway Surfers‚Äù using real-time pose detection. By allowing players to control the game through natural body movements, we aim to enhance the gameplay experience while promoting physical activity.

Introduction
Video games offer an immersive experience, transporting players to virtual worlds where they can explore, compete, and interact. However, excessive screen time and sedentary behavior associated with gaming can have adverse effects on health. As game developers and researchers, we recognize the need to strike a balance between entertainment and physical well-being.

Project Overview
Our project focuses on enhancing the gameplay experience of the widely popular mobile game ‚ÄúSubway Surfers‚Äù. Instead of traditional touch controls, we propose implementing a gesture-based control system. Players will use natural body movements to navigate the game, making it more engaging and physically active.

Technical Approach
We will leverage computer vision techniques to detect and track the player‚Äôs body movements. Specifically, we will use the following tools and technologies:
1.	OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library that provides various functions for image processing, object detection, and feature extraction.
2.	Mediapipe: A Google-developed library for real-time pose estimation and tracking. It offers pre-trained models for detecting key body landmarks.
3.	Python: Our primary programming language for implementing the gesture control system.

Implementation 
1.	Data Collection: We will collect a dataset of body poses by capturing video sequences of players performing various gestures (e.g., swiping, jumping, bending). These videos will serve as training data for our pose estimation model.
2.	Pose Estimation Model: Using Mediapipe, we will train a pose estimation model to recognize key body landmarks (e.g., hands, head, knees) from the video frames.
3.	Gesture Mapping: We will map specific gestures (e.g., raising both hands to jump, swiping left or right) to in-game actions (e.g., jumping, changing lanes).
4.	Integration with Subway Surfers: Our gesture control system will replace the traditional touch controls in the game. Players will perform gestures in front of their device‚Äôs camera to control the character‚Äôs movements.

Expected Outcomes
1.	Enhanced Gameplay: Players will experience a more immersive and physically active gameplay by using natural gestures.
2.	Healthier Gaming: By encouraging body movement, our system aims to mitigate the negative effects of sedentary gaming.
3.	User Engagement: Gesture-based controls can attract new players and retain existing ones.

Conclusion
The Gesture-Controlled Subway Surfers project bridges the gap between entertainment and health. By combining cutting-edge technology with a popular game, we hope to create a positive impact on players‚Äô well-being. Let‚Äôs play Subway Surfers in reality like a VR 2.0 using gestures! üéÆüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
